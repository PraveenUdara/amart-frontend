          <h3>Oncotype DX</h3>
          <p>
            We joined hands with MediLinks to provide Oncotype DX to Sri Lankans. The Oncotype DX test is a genomic test that analyzes the activity of a group of genes that can affect how a cancer is likely to behave and respond to treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Oncotype DX is used in two ways: (1) Help doctors figure out a woman's risk of early-stage, estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer coming back (recurrence), as well as how likely she is to benefit from chemotherapy after breast cancer surgery. (2) Help doctors figure out a woman's risk of DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) coming back and/or the risk of a new invasive cancer developing in the same breast, as well as how likely she is to benefit from radiation therapy after DCIS surgery.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of all the breast cancer genomic tests, the Oncotype DX test has the strongest research behind it.
